# D3 meter chat via chatGPT
Have asked the following questions in order generate proper working meter chart but there are some issues it did not work well. It is like half job done only

- `How can I create a meter chart with D3?`
- `Can you improve the UI with some color change like going from red to green in the meter chart?`
- `Can you do this with animation?`
- `Getting the same error; it did not solve "script4.js:79 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'endAngle')"`
- `I am sorry, but the above code is not working; the arc is not changing as per the passed value.`
- `Why is "const interpolate = d3.interpolate(d.endAngle, newAngle);" this line throwing an error?`
- `Now the error is gone, but the arc distorts on animation and appears correct in the end.`
- `The value d.endAngle throws an error since d is not defined.`
- `The above code is not working; the arc is not changing as per the passed value.`
- `Why is the argument not passed in the arcTween inner function properly? It is throwing an error on d.endAngle.`
